.SH NAME
aptk \- package managing daemon proving a D-Bus interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B aptk
.RI [ OPTIONS ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B aptk
allows one to perform package management tasks, e.g. installing or removing
software, using a D-Bus interface. The privileges are handled by PolicyKit
so the client application doesn't need to run as root. Furthermore aptk is
started by D-Bus activation only when an user calls a method.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-d, --debug"
Show additional information on the command line.
.IP "-h, --help"
Show information about the usage of the command.
.IP "-r, --replace"
Replace another aptk instance if it is running.
.IP "-p PROFILE_FILE"
Write profiling data to
.I PROFILE_FILE
using Python's profiler. This is only of use to developers.
.IP "-t, --disable-timeout"
Do not shutdown the daemon after an idle time.
.IP "--dummy"
Instead of applying the changes to the system only show a progress. This option is only usable for developers to locate problems in client applications.
